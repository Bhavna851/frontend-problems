        <h1>ALBERT EINSTEIN</h1>
    <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 to 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist 
    best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contribution
    to quantum theory. His mass energy equivalence formula E = mc^2, which arises from special relativity,
    has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for
    "his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
    effect".</p>
